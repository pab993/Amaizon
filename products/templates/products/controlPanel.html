                    <strong><p>Welcome to the control panel. From here you can calculate the neighborhood of the users for the recommended products. It is advisable to carry out this operation relatively frequently to ensure a better recommendation of products to users.</p></strong>
                    <strong><p>The threshold number will determine if the similarity between neighboring users is greater than or equal to that established in order to make the prediction more accurately. A very high value could cause no recommendations to be displayed and a very low value would cause a bad prediction.</p></strong>
